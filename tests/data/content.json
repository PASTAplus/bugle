    "About EDI",
    " About EDI  Vision & Mission  The Environmental Data Initiative envisions a future of intensified and diverse scientific discovery fueled by data commons accessible to all.  We preserve environmental data for open and reproducible science, to promote synthesis across space and time, and to aid in the assessment of environmental change and its consequences.  Project  The Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) provides key services and technical expertise to the scientific community that ensure environmental and ecological data are well curated and accessible for discovery and re-use well into the future. We assist researchers from field stations, individual laboratories, and research projects of all sizes to archive and publish their environmental data. EDI is committed to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).  We provide support, training, and resources to help archive and publish high-quality data and metadata. We operate a secure data repository and work closely with other leaders in information management, like the LTER Network Communications Office and DataONE, to promote data management best practices and stewardship. Our team consists of highly motivated and experienced data practitioners, software developers, and research scientists.  EDI is currently funded through grants from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Biological Infrastructure to the University of New Mexico (Award #1931143) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Award #1931174): \"Collaborative Research: Environmental Data Initiative: Sustaining the Legacy of Scientific Data\".

Repository Infrastructure  Development of the Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA) software began in 2009 by LTER information managers and software developers with the goal to serve as the LTER Network Information System data repository. A full production system was delivered to the LTER Network in January 2013 and quickly acquired a majority of LTER's data products (> 5,900 as of January 2017). PASTA's design was patterned on a Service Oriented Architecture to provide scalable data-repository functionality through a ReST-based application programmable interface (API), with primary operations to create, read, update, and delete (often termed CRUD) data packages to and from the repository. In addition, the PASTA development team delivered a browser-based web application for LTER called the Data Portal that gives users a human accessible interface to interact with PASTA. This was followed by an LTER Member Node (MN) in the DataONE federation, which exposes LTER data packages through DataONE's search and catalog service.  By necessity, the original iteration of PASTA was LTER-centric. With the advent of EDI, aspects of the PASTA software that were idiomatic to LTER practices were generalized for broader use (or removed completely) into a revised software stack called PASTA+ ( https://github.com/PASTAplus ), which provides the underlying services for the EDI data repository. In simple terms, the EDI data repository is a \"re-branding\" of the LTER Network Information System data repository, including the full archive of LTER data packages, and uses the revised PASTA+ software stack. Because PASTA+ is backwards compatible with the previous PASTA API, the LTER Data Portal seamlessly interacts with the PASTA+ API. To promote broader inclusivity, EDI software developers released a generalized version of the LTER Data Portal in late 2016, which also interacts directly with the PASTA+ API. The EDI Data Portal can be used in lieu of the LTER Data Portal to access both LTER and non-LTER data packages. In March 2017, EDI released a new DataONE member node that exposes non-LTER data packages to the DataONE federation. Collectively, the infrastructure of EDI includes the EDI data repository, which uses the PASTA+ software stack, the EDI Data Portal, the EDI DataONE Member Node, and the LTER DataONE Member Node, in addition to a suite of software tools for information and data management ( https://github.com/EDIorg ).  Physical Management and Curation of Digital Products  EDI employs industry standard protocols to ensure that all scientific data are well documented, secure, and persist for future use.  Standards for Data, Metadata, and Software  EDI's data repository accepts data in any digital format. All science data curated by EDI is required to be described and documented with the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) standard (see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/tools/ eml). The data repository supports versions 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.2.0 of EML. EML is a semantically rich science metadata standard that is actively supported as an open source project.  EDI-developed software products fall into two categories: the PASTA+ software stack for the data repository and software in support of general data management practices. All EDI software development follows principles utilized by open source projects, including frequent and incremental submittals of written code, documentation, and architectural diagrams to a recognized software repository. EDI uses two separate GitHub repositories for software management and control: one for PASTA+ software at https://github.com/PASTAplus and another for data management support tools at https://github.com/EDIorg .  The PASTA+ software is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 (AL2.0) ( http://www.apache.org/licenses ). AL2.0 is known as a \"permissive\" software license, which means that a user is free to download the software, to modify the software, and to use the software for any purpose without concern for royalties. AL2.0 is compatible with the GNU General Public License v3 \"copyleft\" software license.  All other digital products (e.g., webinar recordings, informational documents) are licensed under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 \"No Rights Reserved\".  Risk Management  Of utmost importance to EDI are the science data and metadata under our curatorial management. The repository's responsibility for science data and metadata begins at the moment of upload when a checksum is computed for all objects and stored as a measurement for comparison during random monitoring, which ensures long-term digital integrity. All objects are cataloged in our data package resource registry and written to physical storage. The science data and metadata are replicated daily to both a permanent mirrored storage device and to a removable storage device using a combination of copy and checksum verification. Once on the mirrored storage device, the aggregate \"data package\" is compressed as a single digital file and written to Amazon Glacier, a high-latency cloud storage service designed for long-term preservation. The removable storage is rotated offsite on a weekly basis. We view both the mirrored storage and removable storage as near-line backup systems for quick recovery of science data and metadata. Data packages stored at Amazon Glacier are considered only for large-scale catastrophic recovery; these data package files are sufficiently complete to fully recover our entire data repository or to allow transfer to another data repository system. Recovery scenario testing is performed on a monthly basis. Science metadata is also replicated to the DataONE Federation (see: https://www.dataone.org/ ) on an hourly basis.  Important operational information of the PASTA+ data repository environment and related services, such as compressed database dumps, log files and virtual machine images are regularly backed up.  Security, Access, and Confidentiality  EDI implements physical security for access to all repository infrastructure. EDI technical staff limits privileged access to only certified personnel. System access logs and accounts are monitored for irregular or malicious activity and all systems operate firewall software that prohibits network intrusion from external sources.  Access to all science data and metadata through the PASTA+ software REST API is controlled through access rules that are declared in the corresponding EML metadata document. In principle, EDI recommends that open access be granted to read science data and metadata, but restricted access be enforced to revise or modify science data or metadata. PASTA+ software supports conditional logic such that rules may be set to allow or deny user access to science data or metadata. In the absence of access rules, PASTA+ defaults to denying access to science data and metadata for all users except for the single user who performed the original data and metadata contribution.  EDI requires users to register in a locally managed LDAP directory before they can contribute science data and metadata to the repository. With the exception of a valid electronic mail address, EDI does not store personal user information. All contributors are vetted and instructed on data and metadata standards before registration occurs. Session authentication is a precondition of upload access. Non-contributors may authenticate through external OAuth/OpenID Connect providers, but will not be allowed upload-access unless mapped to an EDI LDAP registration.  Access logs contain only the identification of users who have performed session authentication; all other users are recorded as \"public\". No Internet address information is recorded in access logs, although the HTTP request agent value is stored to filter potential Internet robots and crawlers. EDI believes that science data and metadata that is collected through public means should be openly available and unfettered where possible.  Reuse and Redistribution  EDI advocates for open and unfettered access to science data and metadata, including data and metadata that reside in the EDI data repository. Science data and metadata contributors have the option to provide a reuse policy of their choice, which is declared within the \"intellectual rights\" section of the EML metadata document. If a contributor reuse policy does not exist in the EML metadata, EDI will apply a default policy that states data and metadata are to be released as \"public domain\" under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 \"No Rights Reserved\" license.  Science data and metadata, which are unfettered per access rules, can be downloaded individually and used in accordance with the stated reuse policy. Similarly, complete data packages can be accessed and downloaded as a single archive in a \"zip\" format, including a contents manifest. In the event that EDI ceases operations, all science data and metadata would be made available on portable storage for transfer to another repository; use of the embedded data package identifier and EML metadata would be possible with minimal effort. Updates to target URLs of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), managed through DataCite, would allow continued resolution to preferred landing pages. If a cessation scenario occurred, the target repository would be requested to support the access rules declared in all EML metadata documents.

    " Policy  Data Policy  Version 0.0, Adopted 25 November 2019  The Environmental Data Initiative (herein EDI) provides services defined as publication and archive of science data to communities world-wide. In accordance with the EDI scope and mission, the following Data Policy statement declares an agreed upon understanding between EDI and the individual or individuals responsible for any and all data submitted to the EDI data repository for the purposes of publication and archive.  Definitions  The following definitions are used throughout this Data Contributor Policy  EDI data contributor. An individual or individuals who are responsible for submitting a data package to the EDI data repository for the purpose of data publication and archive.  EDI customer. An individual or individuals who utilizes EDI's data publication and archive service.  EDI data repository. An Internet-based scientific data repository service for scientific data publication and archive.  EDI data publication and archive. The process by which scientific data and metadata are made discoverable and available through EDI computational infrastructure, including the long-term curation and management of such data.  EDI website. The official EDI Internet website ( https://environmentaldatainitiative.org ) where general information about EDI, including policies, news, events, and featured scientific data may be accessed.  Science Data. Data collected by external parties that is published and archived by EDI.  Science Data Package. The aggregate product produced by combining science data with science metadata.  Science Metadata. Textual metadata describing scientific data that is published and archived by EDI  Data Package Accessibility  EDI strives to make environmental research data open and accessible to the general public without undue restrictions or barriers. Although EDI strongly recommends all data be publicly available, we recognize that some data may require limited access while it is under review during manuscript preparation. In these cases, the EDI Data Repository supports access control to data when justified by the data provider, thereby limiting exposure of the data resource to only users with appropriate permission . Such access control must be clearly specified in the data package metadata. EDI will also accept data that requires a permanent embargo due to issues of sensitivity (e.g., the location of endangered species or antiquities). Although EDI will enforce access control of data as specified in the data package metadata, EDI does not guarantee the privacy of such information. If data are to be submitted to the EDI Data Repository with restricted access, we request that an explanation of the data embargo, including if and when the data will be made available to the general public, be provided in the data entity description field of the data package metadata. Only for extreme circumstances will EDI allow both the metadata and data to be restricted *. EDI reserves the right to periodically review restricted data to determine if embargos continue to be justified.  *Access to science metadata and data must be granted explicitly within the data package metadata (access is denied by default). Data packages containing restricted data (i.e., not publicly accessible) will not be shared with DataONE.  ** The restriction of an entire data package (both metadata and data) should be arranged with EDI prior to submitting the data package to the data repository. Data packages that do not allow public access to both science metadata and data will not receive a Digital Object Identifier.  Sensitive Data  Under no circumstance will EDI knowingly accept data that is protected by Federal, State, or local laws and policies (e.g., FERPA, HIPAA, or IRB restrictions on human subject data). In addition, science metadata often contains personal data of individuals involved in scientific research. These personal data may be available to other EDI customers and the general public through an EDI website. As such, EDI requires that the individual or individuals responsible for submitting science data packages to EDI for the purpose of data publication and archive acknowledges that such science data and metadata is not restricted by any governing laws and policies or that personal data contained within science metadata does so only with the explicit knowledge and permission of the individual or individuals it affects.  Offline Data  There is an option to declare data \"offline\" within the distribution field of the data package metadata. Doing so eliminates the need to have data be \"network\" accessible to the EDI Data Repository during the data package upload process. The use of offline data is only recommended for data that are too voluminous for network or storage capacity, such as the output from numerical models. Offline data must be provided to the EDI Data Repository through alternative means (e.g., SSD drive via a common carrier) prior to uploading the data package metadata. EDI requests that an explanation of the offline status be provided in the data entity description field of the data package metadata, including the preferred method of data distribution if required to satisfy a data request. See here for details: .  Intellectual Rights of the Data Contributor  EDI makes every effort to ensure that all data are curated with intellectual rights defined by the data provider as found in the data package metadata. Although EDI advocates for open and unfettered access to data packages without use restrictions, we do not forbid data providers from declaring more restrictive licensing agreements for use of their data packages. Data providers should include a statement of Intellectual Rights in the metadata of their submissions. If they do not, EDI reserves the right to add a default declaration of intellectual rights to the data package metadata. The default declaration of intellectual rights used by EDI is based on the Creative Commons CC0 \"No Rights Reserved\" waiver. See below for the full default statement:  \"This data package is released to the \"public domain\" under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 \"No Rights Reserved\" (see: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The process by which scientific data and metadata are made discoverable and available through EDI computational infrastructure, including the long-term curation and management of such data.  EDI website. The official EDI Internet website (https://environmentaldatainitiative.org) where general information about EDI, including policies, news, events, and featured scientific data may be accessed.  EDI workshop. An organized and scheduled effort by EDI (or scientific partner) personnel to disseminate educational materials related to scientific data publication and archive to EDI customers.  PASTA+ software. The software (https://github.com/PASTAplus/PASTA) developed, maintained, and used by EDI to provide its data publication and archive service.  Personal data. Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, which may include: common name, surname, given name, email address, organizational associations (name, address, phone), and or unique identifier (such as ORCID or GitHub identity).  Science Data. Data collected by external parties that is published and archived by EDI.  Science Metadata. Textual metadata describing scientific data that is published and archived by EDI  Why and How We Collect Personal Data   Dissemination of EDI news and updates. EDI sends news items and updates about our project, operation, and services to EDI customers who subscribe to such information. Customers must actively submit personal data, including: email (required), surname (optional), given name (optional), organization (optional), and organizational role (optional), to EDI's MailChimp (https://mailchimp.com) account. These personal data are not shared with any 3rd party or partner.  Customer identity information for authorization to EDI data repository services and scientific data and metadata. EDI restricts access to some data repository services (e.g., publishing and archiving scientific data) to a subset of customers who have agreed to our data publication policy. In addition, customers who contribute science data and metadata have the option to apply access control to their data and metadata to limit distribution of their products. Customers who identify through an EDI accepted authentication protocol can be filtered against one or more rules used to allow or deny access to EDI data repository services or scientific data and metadata. Customers who require the ability to publish and archive science data and metadata must request an EDI LDAP account through an EDI representative. An EDI LDAP account requires a unique customer identifier composed into an LDAP distinguished name, given name, surname, and valid email address. Customers who only require identification to access controlled science data or metadata may use a third party identity service (either Google, GitHub, or ORCID) to verify their identity; successful authentication through the third party stores either the customer's gmail email address, GitHub home location, or ORCID identifier, respectively, into the active EDI web browser session, in addition to the customer's common name.  Customer email or other contact information. EDI customers may register contact information with EDI for the purpose of notification when the creation, addition, or modification of science data and metadata that is curated by EDI occurs within the EDI data repository. Notifications of this type serve to inform customers when new or updated science data are added to the system or to alert customers when science data are found to be suspect or erroneous post-publication. The collection of customer contact information is an option provided to EDI customers during an authenticated web browser session. Customer contact information includes only an email address.  Web browser session cookies and authentication tokens. EDI websites utilize web browser session cookies and authentication tokens to maintain an authenticated state between the customer's web browser and EDI's website services. Session cookies are generated by the EDI website and authentication tokens are generated by the EDI authentication service at the point a customer self-identifies. EDI authentication tokens include the customer's unique identifier, a token time-to-live, and any membership in recognized roles or groups.   Security of Collected Personal Data  All collected personal data are transmitted using HTTP SSL encryption when on the open Internet and restricted behind EDI system firewalls when operated on within the EDI data repository service oriented architecture.  Personal Data Found within Science Metadata  Personal data may be found within science metadata in the form of contact information pertaining to the origin of the science data and metadata. EDI does not actively collect such personal data; such personal data is provided by EDI customers who wish to publish and archive science data and metadata. EDI does require customers to acknowledge that the owners of this personal data have agreed to its release as part of the publication process. This type of personal data (i.e., contact information) is critical for consumers of science data and metadata to better determine the nature and origin of the science data and metadata when ascertaining fitness for use. In addition, science metadata may contain customer unique identifiers to enable the processing of access control.  Transparency and Sharing of Personal Data  EDI records customer identity information, if available, within EDI's activity audit to better understand what and when published science data and metadata are accessed within the EDI data repository. This information is coupled with the date and time of access and the science data or metadata that is accessed. This information may be summarized and provided to our funding agencies to justify continued operations. In addition, EDI may share the same detailed audit information with customers who contribute science data and metadata so that they may better understand the reuse and efficacy of their science data and metadata publication.  Personal Data Retention, Access and Removal of Personal Data  EDI retains the aforementioned personal data within EDI's computational infrastructure for an indefinite period of time. Upon written request to support@environmentaldatainitiative.org and with proper identification, EDI will provide the requested with a report of all recorded instances of personal data in digital format and or remove all instances of personal data.  Code of Conduct  The Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) is an NSF funded project helping to accelerate the curation and archive of environmental data. We operate and maintain a reliable, registered, and certified trustworthy data repository for ecological research data. EDI provides training on the data archiving process as well as data management best practices through events such as webinars, workshops and fellowships as well as individual support by EDI's information managers.  EDI is committed to providing a safe, productive and welcoming environment for all participants and staff while at any EDI sponsored event or venue.  All participants\u2014including, but not limited to, attendees, speakers, instructors, fellows and their hosts, volunteers, contractors, EDI staff and guests\u2014are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies in all venues, including ancillary events and social gatherings, whether officially sponsored by EDI or not.  Expected Behavior   Treat all participants, attendees, fellows, staff, and vendors with kindness, respect and consideration, valuing a diversity of views and opinions (including those you may not share).  Communicate openly with respect for other participants, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.  Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech directed toward others, whether in person, in print, or online.  Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.  Respect the rules and policies of the meeting venue.  Abide by principles of academic integrity and ethical professional conduct.   Unacceptable Behavior   Harassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form is unacceptable. Harassment includes speech or behavior that is not welcome or is personally offensive. Behavior that is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another, so use discretion to be sure respect is communicated.  Verbal harassment includes comments, epithets, slurs, threats, and negative stereotyping that are offensive, hostile, disrespectful, or unwelcome.  Non-verbal harassment includes actions or distribution, display, or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles, or shows hostility, aversion, or disrespect toward a group or individual. The use of sexual and/or discriminatory images in public spaces or in presentations is also considered harassment.    Examples of unacceptable behavior include\u2014but are not limited to\u2014unwelcome or offensive verbal comments related to age, appearance or body size, employment or military status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, individual lifestyle, marital status, national origin, physical or cognitive ability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, race, or religion.  Retaliation and reporting an incident in bad faith both undermine the safe, productive and welcoming environment we are striving to create and will also be subject to consequences.   Consequences  EDI reserves the right to enforce this Code of Conduct in any manner deemed appropriate. Except in the most egregious cases, anyone violating the Code of Conduct will first be asked to cease these behaviors. Failure to comply with requests can result in escalating consequences which may include expulsion from the event or prohibition from future events.  Reporting  If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a member of the EDI staff, preferably one of the principal investigators, Corinna Gries or Mark Servilla.  Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to individual or public safety at any of the events organized by EDI is advised to contact venue security or local law enforcement.

This allows you to focus on communicating the other important aspects of data that cannot be inferred. Our quality checker helps ensure that metadata accurately describes the data.  Publication Quality Data for Reuse  Our open-access data repository provides valuable publication-quality data for future scientific inquiries. We hold a thematically diverse collection of data with temporal extents ranging from days to decades, and a global spatial extent though mostly within the United States. Published data can be revised and updated while previous versions are still available.  Tools to Support Research  We support research with tools to revise a dataset, create a personalized data catalog/collection, report to funders, find data, explore data, import data, or inject automation into scientific workflows. If you have other needs, tell us and we will work to incorporate it into our offerings.  A Secure and Persistent Archive  We assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and guarantee immutability for all data for long-term access, transparency, and reuse. The EDI data repository satisfies DataCite standards for accurate and consistent identification of digital resources for citation and retrieval purposes and are actively working towards Core Trust Seal requirements of trustworthy repositories. We participate in the development of data standards (e.g. FAIR, TRUST, CARE) and adopt their recommendations.  Timely One-on-One Support  Science doesn't operate on banking hours and neither do we. Our team can be reached via email or Slack to address any questions or issues. We offer support and advise on a range of topics from data curation to software design. If we don't have an answer, we can refer you to someone who does.  Streamlined Citation & Attribution  All data publications are first class research objects which when cited will be fully attributed to personal research profiles. We work with ORCiD, ROR, DataCite, and Crossref to ensure data packages are linked to journal manuscripts where possible and apply schema.org recommendations to our metadata for automatic update of Google Scholar and ORCiD profiles.  Enhanced Discovery  Data in the EDI repository are findable in the EDI search portal, DataONE, and Google Dataset Search Engine. We index metadata features commonly found in user searches for our advanced search interface. As a DataONE member our data are discoverable alongside other repositories in the DataONE Network. And finally, we mark up  data package landing pages with schema.org metadata enabling an additional path of discovery by users of the Google Dataset Search.  Data Exploration & Analysis  Three data exploration tools provide a quick interactive view into a dataset and thereby deepening understanding of a data package beyond the metadata alone. First, our data exploration tool DEX is an interface for exploring and subsetting tabular data directly from our data portal. Second, the datapie R package provides a similar interface but broadens access to any data published in the DataONE network as well as to data stored on a local computer. Finally, Data Import Scripts are automatically generated for each data package in common languages (MatLab, Python, R, SAS, SPSS, tidyr), providing immediate access to manipulation and analysis.  Analysis Ready Data  Published data varies greatly in terms of format and structure, thereby making data reformatting a large component of the synthesis workflow. Our thematic standardization process accelerates integration and synthesis of data within our repository and across collaborating repositories. Two projects, ecocomDP and hydromet, are now underway and involve collaborations with LTER sites,NEON, CUAHSI, and GBIF.  Workflow Automation  Automating workflows have a larger impact with less effort. Our repository REST API provides programmatic access to data and services for automation of common data curation tasks, reporting to stakeholders, and enables automation of fully open and reproducible science analysis workflows.  Training & Skill Building  Our data management curriculum is based on 40+ years of information management expertise, including from the U.S. LTER Network, and contributes to improving data management across the environmental science community. We have begun migrating our training and skill-building to an entirely online and self-learning format to broaden community access while retaining the one-on-one support that makes a lasting impact.  Personalized Data Catalogs (Coming Soon)  Personalized data catalogs are simple to create and maintain. This approach leverages the archived data and metadata in our repository to create a searchable index within a personal or project\u2019s website, thus reducing overhead while facilitating customized branding and an additional avenue of discovery.  Linked Data & AI Applications (Coming Soon)  Semantic annotation enables linked data for better human understanding, machine actionability, and the future of AI-driven scientific applications. Data packages are now being annotated with semantic markup by our data curators and planning for integration of search and use technologies with our repository is under development.  Computational Environments (Coming Soon)  Connecting EDI data to computational environments will decrease compute times and enable effective collaboration within and across research groups. We are working with CyVerse to bring their services to EDI users and are in the process of designing a plan to integrate Jupyter Notebooks and Binder with hosted data.
